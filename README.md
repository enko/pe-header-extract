# Extract PE-header from EXE-files

Currently only version informations are implemented.

The core code with all the hard work is taken form this SO-question:

[Get Version of exe via PHP](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2029409/get-version-of-exe-via-php)

## ToDo

Extract more PE-header-information and create some better data structures, which reflects the data of the pe header better.
